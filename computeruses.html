    <h2>The Guide to Information Technology and Its Role During COVID-19</h2>
    
    <h3>As we entered into a brand new year and a new decade, many people got excited about the possibilities 2020 promised. People chose new year’s resolutions like more travel, more savings, or learning new skills. Many businesses planned to start the new decade on the right foot, with detailed business plans and quarterly goals already estimated. No one could have expected that a couple of months later, the world would be on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19. The novel coronavirus disease has forced health authorities and government officials to urge people into quarantine, allowing them to leave the safety of their homes under specific circumstances – purchasing essential items, work (if deemed essential workers), or seeking medical attention. With people only going out to get essential items and for work, the world comes to a standstill to ensure disease control and prevention. The severity and reach of the coronavirus pandemic have drastically changed our everyday lives. In the middle of all the chaos and confusion the virus brings, it seems that information technology has a crucial role in maintaining a sense of normality. We are going to look at the ways in which IT has helped us in tackling the disruption caused by COVID19. If you have found yourself in need of a career change due to COVID19, a field with job security like Information Technology might be the right fit for you. Find out more about how you can go from no experience to an IT professional in just a few months.</h3>
    
     <h2>What Is Information Technology?</h2>
   <h3>In order to understand how information technology is helping us through the coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to recognize what IT encompasses. Information technology (IT) is a broad field that covers all functions and processes relating to computers or technology in an organization or business. It is often used to refer to computers and networks, but it encompasses an enormous scope of work that handles technological problems in companies, institutions, or any other organizations that manage information. IT includes all aspects of sharing information over a variety of networks and the internet as a whole. These include physical hardware, operating systems, applications, storage, databases, servers e.t.c. Information technology has gone through many breakthroughs and advancements over the last couple of years and has infiltrated every part of our daily lives. As it provides convenience and makes our lives easier, we find ourselves investing more resources into upgrading and keeping it around. This has definitely paid off during difficult times because it makes things much more manageable in times of crisis. Many people underestimate just how widespread information technology has become; this could be a simple case of growing accustomed to IT and everything it has to offer. These are the ways IT helps us during the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus</h3>

<h2>Healthcare System</h2>

<h3>One of the biggest fields that IT is making a difference during the COVID-19 pandemic is in health care. Technology has played a huge part in improving standards in world health organizations, hospitals, testing facilities, and laboratories. We often overlook just how widespread IT is in the medical field. Digital health has become an important part of the medical world and plays a vital role during these difficult times. Modern hospitals and healthcare facilities have digital tools and information technology everywhere. In fact, it encompasses, everything from devices the that enable virtual care, which allows healthcare providers to monitor patients and communicate with any coronavirus disease patient 24/7 without being physically present, to the networks that store clinical data and enable institutions and professionals to quickly gain access and share patient data, test results, and other health information whenever needed. Many overlook health information technology’s role in patient care, patient engagement, and even training for medical students. If you want to get an idea of how much technology plays a role in the health system, look at the videos that come out of hospitals during this outbreak. We tend to notice the health officials, heroic doctors, and nurses that put their lives on the line battling infectious diseases. We don’t instantly notice medical devices and apparatuses that utilize information technology to help medical professionals provide acute care for people in need. It is important that we acknowledge them as an important resource in battling the COVID-19 outbreak. Finally, we need to mention how IT is proving to be extremely useful in helping people all around the world secure important resources. In a time when many clinical resources are becoming scarce, treating COVID-19 patients becomes increasingly difficult. Some of the most important resources related to keeping critical patients stable are ventilators. It is estimated that about 30% of patients that experience life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms will require mechanical ventilation to stay alive. With increasing numbers of patients, healthcare institutions are facing shortages. Many firms are coming together to work on effective and easy-to-make ventilators that will keep patients alive. They are using IT to share schematics and blueprints that enable institutions to create their own functioning ventilators.</h3>
